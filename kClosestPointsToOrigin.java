// We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

// (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

// You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique 
// (except for the order that it is in.)


// Example 1:

// Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
// Output: [[-2,2]]
// Explanation: 
// The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
// The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
// Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
// We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
// Example 2:

// Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
// Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
// (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
