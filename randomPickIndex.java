Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. 
You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);


SOLUTION - resovior sambling 

// To those who don't understand why it works. Consider the example in the OJ
// {1,2,3,3,3} with target 3, you want to select 2,3,4 with a probability of 1/3 each.

// 2 : It's probability of selection is 1 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3
// 3 : It's probability of selection is (1/2) * (2/3) = 1/3
// 4 : It's probability of selection is just 1/3

// So they are each randomly selected. EACH INDEX, has equal chance of being selected!!

class Solution {
    
    int[] nums; 
    Random rnd; 

    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        this.rnd = new Random();
        
    }
    
    public int pick(int target) {
        int randomIndex = -1;
        
        int count = 0; //keep track of number of occurences of target;
        
        for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] != target){
                continue;
            }
            count++; // we have reached a target number so increment
            if(rnd.nextInt(count) == 0){  //choose a random number between [0-count) , so exclude count in the range 
                randomIndex = i;
            }
        }
    
        return randomIndex; 
    }
}

// At Say we now we have nums=[1,5,5,6,5,7,9,0] and the target is 5.

// Now let's focus on the loop. When i=1, we get the first target number, and by rnd.nextInt(++count) we 
// select a random number between [0, 1), which means actually you could only select 0, so the probability 
// of making result = 1 is 1.

// Keep going. In the loop where i = 2, we get the second number. Now we have to get a random number in {0,1}. 
// So what should we do if we want to keep result = 1? It's simple: we have to make sure that, at this time, 
// the random number generated should be 1 rather than 0 (otherwise the value of result will be changed),
//  so the probability of keeping result = 1 is 1 * 1/2.

// It is similar when we get the third target number, i.e., i = 4. Now we have to get a random number 
// in {0,1,2}. If we still wish to keep result = 1, the only way is to randomly get number 1 or 2 rather than
//  0, and the probability is 2/3. So the total probability of keeping result = 1 will be 1 * 1/2 * 2/3.

// Since we have four target number 5 here, the final probability of keeping result = 1 
// would be 1 * 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/4, which means the probability of picking index 0 is 1/4 as 
// the problem required. The probability is the same if you wish to pick another index.

// You may ask what is the probability of picking the last possible index 4? Well, it simpler. 
// You may ignore all operations before the loop where i = 4, and the only thing you have to do is 
// to get the random number 0 among {0,1,2,3} in the loop where i = 4, so the probability is exactly 1/4.
